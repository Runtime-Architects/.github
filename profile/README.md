# 🌆 Sustainable City AI

**Multi-Agent Intelligence for a Carbon-Neutral Europe**

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for **Sustainable City AI** — a cutting-edge initiative developing scalable, AI-powered systems to drive sustainable energy decisions across the European Union.

Our mission is to bridge energy data, artificial intelligence, and everyday citizens through real-time insights and secure multi-agent collaboration — all in support of Europe’s climate goals.

## 🌱 Why It Matters

Sustainable City AI isn't just an energy advisory tool — it's an intelligent, collaborative ecosystem built to:
- Empower citizens to make informed, eco-conscious decisions
- Help governments and businesses analyze demand and optimize energy use
- Accelerate the EU's transition to a sustainable, net-zero future
